     - You can adjust this later

**Deliverable**: App Store Connect record created and configured

---

## Phase 2: Core Compliance Features (Week 3-4)

### Step 4: Implement Server-Side Age Verification
**Priority: HIGH**

Current implementation (client-side) is insufficient for App Store compliance.

1. **Create Firebase Cloud Function** for age verification:
   ```typescript
   // functions/src/verifyAge.ts
   export const verifyAge = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
     const { dateOfBirth } = data;
     const age = calculateAge(dateOfBirth);

     if (age < 21) {
       throw new functions.https.HttpsError('failed-precondition', 'Must be 21+');
     }

     // Store verification status in Firestore
     await admin.firestore().collection('users').doc(context.auth.uid).update({
       isAgeVerified: true,
       dateOfBirth: dateOfBirth,
       verifiedAt: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
     });

     return { verified: true };
   });
   ```

2. **Update `AgeVerificationScreen.tsx`**:
   ```typescript
   const verifyAge = async () => {
     try {
       const result = await functions().httpsCallable('verifyAge')({
         dateOfBirth: `${year}-${month}-${day}`
       });

       if (result.data.verified) {
         navigation.navigate("Auth");
       }
     } catch (error) {
       Alert.alert("Verification Failed", error.message);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Enforce verification** on app launch:
   - Check `isAgeVerified` status in Firestore
   - Redirect unverified users to AgeVerificationScreen
   - Prevent bypassing via app reinstall

**Deliverable**: Server-side age verification functional

---

### Step 5: Implement Geo-Restrictions
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Install Expo Location**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-location
   ```

2. **Update `App.tsx`** to check location on launch:
   ```typescript
   import { checkGeoRestriction } from './src/services/geoRestriction';
   import GeoRestrictedScreen from './src/screens/GeoRestrictedScreen';

   export default function App() {
     const [isRestricted, setIsRestricted] = useState(false);
     const [restrictionMessage, setRestrictionMessage] = useState("");

     useEffect(() => {
       async function checkLocation() {
         const result = await checkGeoRestriction();
         if (result.isRestricted) {
           setIsRestricted(true);
           setRestrictionMessage(getRestrictionMessage(result));
         }
       }
       checkLocation();
     }, []);

     if (isRestricted) {
       return <GeoRestrictedScreen message={restrictionMessage} />;
     }

     return <AppNavigator />;
   }
   ```

3. **Update `app.config.js`** permissions:
   ```javascript
   ios: {
     infoPlist: {
       NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription: "VapeMate needs your location to verify regional availability and comply with local regulations.",
     },
   },
   ```

4. **Test geo-restrictions**:
   - Use device simulator to test different locations
   - Verify restricted regions show GeoRestrictedScreen

**Deliverable**: Geo-restriction enforcement functional

---

### Step 6: Add Health Warnings
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Create HealthWarningModal component**:
   ```typescript
   // src/components/HealthWarningModal.tsx
   export default function HealthWarningModal({ visible, onAccept }) {
     return (
       <Modal visible={visible}>
         <View>
           <Text style={styles.warning}>‚ö†Ô∏è Health Warning</Text>
           <Text>
             Vaping products contain nicotine, which is an addictive substance.
             Nicotine is harmful and may be especially harmful to pregnant women.
             This product is not a smoking cessation device.
           </Text>
           <Button title="I Understand" onPress={onAccept} />
         </View>
       </Modal>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Show warning on first launch**:
   - Use AsyncStorage to track if warning shown
   - Display modal before allowing app access
   - Also show in Settings > Health Information

3. **Add warning to ProfileScreen**:
   ```typescript
   <TouchableOpacity style={styles.menuItem}>
     <Ionicons name="warning" size={24} color="#ef4444" />
     <Text style={styles.menuText}>Health Information</Text>
   </TouchableOpacity>
   ```

**Deliverable**: Health warnings displayed prominently

---

### Step 7: Implement Account Deletion
**Priority: HIGH** (Required by Apple)

1. **Add "Delete Account" to ProfileScreen**:
   ```typescript
   const handleDeleteAccount = () => {
     Alert.alert(
       "Delete Account",
       "Are you sure? This action cannot be undone.",
       [
         { text: "Cancel", style: "cancel" },
         { text: "Delete", style: "destructive", onPress: deleteAccount }
       ]
     );
   };

   const deleteAccount = async () => {
     // Delete user data from Firestore
     await firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).delete();

     // Delete Firebase Auth account
     await auth().currentUser.delete();

     // Sign out and redirect
     navigation.navigate("Welcome");
   };
   ```

2. **Implement data export** (GDPR/CCPA):
   - Create "Download My Data" option
   - Export user data as JSON
   - Email or allow download

**Deliverable**: Account deletion and data export functional
